Function returns new frame based on original frame where all keys from included frames are migrated to the parent frame and included frames themselfs are deleted.

In case of keys collisions, the parent key value takes priority.

USAGE

    flat(<frame>) -> <frame>

EXAMPLE

    flat([a:1,f:[b:2]]) -> [a:1,b:2]
    flat([a:1,f:[a:2]]) -> [a:1]
    flat([f:[a:1],g:[a:2]]) -> [a:1]
